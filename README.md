# Quiz Game

## Description

The following challenge involved creating a multiple-choice quiz game. The game is required to have a timer and ability to store a user’s score at the end. If the timer runs out, the quiz will automatically be over. The score the user receives is the residual time left at the end of the series of questions.
-	The game begins when the user clicks “start”
    - The timer begins to count down and the user is presented with the first question
-	Once the user answers the question, they are moved on to the next one
    - If answered incorrectly, 5 seconds is subtracted from the remaining time
-	The game is over once the user answers all questions or the timer hits 0
-	The user can save their scores at the game over screen
    - The user’s initial cannot be blank or more than 2 characters
-	Once the user clicks “save” or “go back”, the quiz can be played again
-	Past scores are displayed on the start page from highest to lowest
